<p>RESQ’s mission is to reach a day where all animals are happy and free from unnecessary suffering. We work towards reducing human-animal conflict by rescuing and treating un-owned street animals who are sick or injured. Through our activities, we also work towards educating and inspiring the urban community to peacefully co-exist with animals on our streets. </p>

Together, we’re making the world a kinder place for street animals and we thank you for that.
