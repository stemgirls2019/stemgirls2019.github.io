Due to its location along the coast, Spanish food has a strong focus on seafood. Famously, cafes and restaurants in Spain offer tapas or pinches. These snack-sized dishes can be made of basically anything and only cost a couple of euros. Before siesta, Spaniards can stop in a local cafe and get a glass of wine and a tapa for merely a couple of euros</P>

  <h1>CHINESE FOOD</h1>
  <P>In a traditional Chinese meal, you can expect to have noodles or rice. Although many American-based Chinese restaurants use fried rice, most China-based Chinese restaurants serve basic steamed rice. With a strong Buddhist history, vegetarian dishes like tofu remain popular. Interestingly, garlic and chilies are considered non-vegetarian in Buddhism because they stimulate the chi. If you go to a Chinese vegetarian restaurant, don’t expect a lot of spices. For non-vegetarian dishes, you can expect Peking duck, thousand year old eggs, squid and a range of meat dishes. Vegetables are always included with dinner, and they are far from your mother’s broccoli. Chinese vegetable dishes are often the most delicious part of the meal.</P>
